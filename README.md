# PyJawaker

Built to Play Tarneeb400 on the mobile version of "Jawaker".

Built for S10+ mirrored with Flow (right aligned on 1080p screen).

Takes various screenshots of the phone screen, analyzes them, and plays the best card (or bid).

# 2024 UPDATE

Finally fixed it. 

Tested on Pixel 8 mirrored with scrcpy (right aligned on 1080p screen).

The code was NOT rewritten. Only what needed to be fixed was fixed. The nature of the logic was NOT changed (or even looked at).
